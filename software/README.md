# LabEmbryoCam User Interface v2.0

This repository contains the python code for running the webserver and corresponding user interface for the LabEmbryoCam systems. A PDF guide for using the software is included here as well (see `software_guide_v2.0.pdf`). 

We recommend downloading the disk image of this software from the `Releases` section as these are validated against a corresponding Raspberry Pi Image.
